# TutorialExitPortal
A beta 1.7.3 plugin that allows a set block in the region (preferrably in the tutorial room) when walked upon to act as a teleport point to a set destination.
Can be used to blend with a 2x1 fake aether portal with water or other portal ideas to mimick a portal.

**Commands:**
- /settutorialexit - Sets the exit point to teleport to the destination point.
- /setdestination - Sets the destination point to teleport to from the exit point.

**Permissions:**

`TutorialExitPortal.SetTutorialExit` - Permission to use the /settutorialexit command.
`TutorialExitPortal.SetDestination` - Permission to use the /setdestination command.
